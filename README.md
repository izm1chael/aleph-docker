# Aleph - OpenSource /Malware Analysis Pipeline System

## What?
Aleph is designed to pipeline the analysis of malware samples. It has a series of collectors that will gather samples from many sources and shove them into the pipeline. The sample manager has a series of plugins that are ran against the sample and returns found data into JSON form.
